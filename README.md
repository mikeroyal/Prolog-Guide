# Prolog Tools

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications.

[Code Server](https://coder.com/) is a tool that allows you to run [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on any machine anywhere and access it in the browser.

[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is an integrated development environment (IDE) that enables a smooth development workflow experience, from design, implementation, building, deploying, testing, and debugging.

[IntelliJ Prolog](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13954-prolog) is a plugin that provides Prolog language support for IntelliJ IDEA.

[SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/) is a comprehensive free Prolog environment. It is widely used in research and education as well as commercial applications.

[SICStus](https://www.sics.se/sicstus/) is a state-of-the-art, [ISO standard compliant](https://webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.aspx?sku=BS+ISO%2fIEC+13211-1%3a1995), Prolog development system. It's built around a high performance Prolog engine that can use the full virtual memory space for 32 & 64-bit architectures. SICStus is efficient and robust for large amounts of data and large applications.

[GNU Prolog](https://www.gprolog.org/) is a free Prolog compiler with constraint solving over finite domains developed by [Daniel Diaz](https://cri-dist.univ-paris1.fr/diaz).

[XSB](https://xsb.sourceforge.net/) is a Logic Programming and Deductive Database system for Unix and Windows.

[Visual Prolog](https://www.visual-prolog.com/) is a multi-paradigm programming language based on the logical language Prolog.

[AbcDatalog](https://abcdatalog.seas.harvard.edu/) is an open-source implementation of the logic programming language Datalog written in Java. It provides ready-to-use implementations of common Datalog evaluation algorithms, as well as some experimental multi-threaded evaluation engines.
